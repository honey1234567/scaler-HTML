Raw Problem
Create a Features section where features will be showcased with necessary headings, divs and Images with feature logos and feature descriptions.

Use the following tags in proper flow:
1. <section> tag to hold all the content for the Feature Section
2. <h1> tag that holds the section heading of 'Awesome Features'
3. <div> tag that groups all the tags associated with a single feature
4. For each feature use -
4.1 <img> tag for feature's image
4.2 <h3> tag for feature's name
4.1 <p> tag for feature's description

To access an image from assets folder correct way to set src attribute is 

src = 'profile.png'

instead of 

src = './assets/profile.png'
